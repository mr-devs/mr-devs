#### About me

At the moment (summer of '24), I am an Informatics PhD candidate in the complex networks and systems track at Indiana University.
Check out my website [www.matthewdeverna.com](https://www.matthewdeverna.com) for the latest information about what I am doing in the world, as I do not update this very often.

#### The coolest thing about me
I spent 2016 backpacking and visited over 20 countries.
I began by spending a handful of months in South East Asia (Thailand ‚û°Ô∏è Laos ‚û°Ô∏è Cambodia).
After working for a couple of months as a bartender on [Koh Rong Island (Cambodia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koh_Rong), I volunteered on a horse farm in Ripoll, Spain (Catalonia) for about a month.
There, I helped with the general upkeep of the farm and property: pouring cement to build a horse stable, restoring a swimming pool, and so on.
After that, I traveled through Spain for another couple of months.
I surfed the couches of friends I made along the way in Barcelona and, later, randomly ran into a friend I had made months earlier in Chang Mai, Thailand in the lobby of a Madrid hostel.
Given the serendipitous nature of the encounter, we decided to travel together.
We worked north from Madrid through various Spanish towns to Pamplona where, [while running with the bulls in the (in)famous festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_of_the_bulls), I lost my shoes and almost got gored. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Next, I met an old friend from America in England.
We bought a crappy car and attempted to drive to Mongolia.
Ultimately, our car died in a desert in Kazakhstan, but we did successfully cross the [Pamir Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M41_highway), starting in Dushanbee, Uzbekistan, and finishing in Osh, Kyrgyzstan.
